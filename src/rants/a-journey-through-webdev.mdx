## quick introduction
i am imide. for some reason, i have decided to build the same app in (at least 5) different web frameworks to see which one i like (and to see which is **objectively** better). 

why? well why not. after watching [theo's video on ghost devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Rvg5zAfT4) and embracing in the red pill known as [theprimagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) (yes, i bake my cake and eat it too), i thought that **i**, a no-good, scrawny teenager from pennsylvania should **not** be a statistic! i will, once and for all, see which web development framework deserves the hate.

**ps:** the results would shock you! (maybe)

## okay, but which frameworks?

to be frank, i dont really know. i have a shortlist but that's about it. in case you're wondering, here is what i want to use:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)
- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev)
- [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/)
- [Go + Echo + Templ + HTMX (cause im swagger)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXP2NYdQCwQ)
- [Laravel (need a lambo)](https://laravel.com/)
- [Rails (because i'm a masochist)](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/)

if you have any other frameworks you recconmend and i should try, feel free to open an [issue/pull request](https://github.com/imide/imide.xyz/issues) or reach me via [discord](https://imide.xyz/me).

## lets do it

the app i will be creating is going to be a copy of [speechdrop.net](https://speechdrop.net), an actually really helpful website for speech and debate. however, the website hasnt been updated in 5+ years (and it's written in java, YUCK!!), i thought it would be nice to 'remaster'.

you can view all of the repos on my [github](https://github.com/imide) or just check back in here later as i will be posting updates.

please wish me luck.
